# **AdvoCat**

## **Overview**

**AdvoCat** is an advanced, AI-powered legal assistant built with **FastAPI**. The application leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide users with instant legal advice and information. It combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques, powered by **spaCy** and **NLTK**, to classify and respond to various legal queries, such as contract laws, general legal terms, and case procedures.

Additionally, the system logs all user queries and responses to a database for analysis and continuous improvement. The app also provides suggested actions and related links to help users better understand their legal concerns.



## **Features**

- **AI-Powered Legal Assistance**: Instant responses generated by OpenAI GPT-3.
- **Predefined Legal Chatbot**: Custom NLP patterns to handle common legal queries.
- **Query Classification**: Categorizes queries and provides suggested actions and related links.
- **Query Logging**: Logs user queries and AI-generated responses in a database (SQLite).
- **Search History**: A `/queries` endpoint to retrieve past user queries and responses.
- **FastAPI Backend**: High-performance API built using FastAPI.



## **Technologies Used**

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **OpenAI GPT-3**: AI model for generating legal advice and answering legal questions.
- **spaCy**: Advanced NLP library used for classifying and extracting entities from legal queries.
- **NLTK**: Provides a simple chatbot structure for predefined legal patterns.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM used for query logging and database interactions.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database for storing user queries and responses.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shamuraanim7/AdvoCat.git
cd AdvoCat
```

2. **Install required dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install spaCy and download the English model**:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

4. **Set OpenAI API Key**:
   Replace `'your_openai_api_key_here'` in the code with your OpenAI API key.



## **Running the Application**

To run the server locally, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI application at `http://localhost:8000`.



## **API Endpoints**

### 1. **POST /ask**

The main endpoint for asking legal questions.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "query": "What is contract law?"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "Contract law is the body of law that governs legally binding agreements between parties.",
  "suggested_actions": ["Review the contract terms thoroughly."],
  "related_links": ["https://www.law.com/contract-terms/"]
}
```

### 2. **GET /queries**

Fetch all previously logged queries and responses.

**Parameters**:
- `skip`: Number of queries to skip (default is 0).
- `limit`: Number of queries to return (default is 10).

**Example**:
```bash
GET /queries?skip=0&limit=10
```

**Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "query": "What is contract law?",
    "response": "Contract law is the body of law that governs legally binding agreements between parties."
  }
]
```



## **Database Setup**

The application uses **SQLite** to store logs of user queries and responses. This helps track previous interactions, analyze trends, and improve the AI's responses.
